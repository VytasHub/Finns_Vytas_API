# Finns_Vytas_API

In this project me (Vytas) and Finn are going to use datasets from www.cso.ie website.
The datasets chosen for the project are as follows:


FNA07 PPSN Allocations to Foreign Nationals by Country and Year 

FNA01 Employment and Social Welfare Activity of Foreign Nationals by Broad Nationality Group, Year of Entry and Year


We want to combine these two datasets so we can link the number of immigrants to Ireland to social welfare activity and employment by country or country group. Store booth of the Datasets in Mongo DB and develop this web application using MEAN stack approach.
